# About Me
My name is Emeric Siebenbrodt. I am a 16-year-old student at WECIB, where I take the cybersecurity path.

## My Interests
### I am interested in many things, such as sports, video games, and spending time outdoors with friends. I like to go to the park as much as I can to play soccer with my friends.

## Websites I Recommend
- [OneFootball](https://onefootball.com/en/home) - This website is what I use to get my news from, as they are fast and accurate with their information.
  
- [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/soccer/) - I not only use ESPN to read the news, but I also enjoy watching games from this website as they stream my favorite second division team.
