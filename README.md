# About Me
My name is Emeric Siebenbrodt. I am a 16 year old students at WECIB. I take the cybersecurity path at my school.
## My Interests
I am interested in many things, such as sports, videogames, and going outside with friends. I like to go to the park as much as I can to play soccer with my friends.
## Websites I Recommend
- [OneFootball](https://onefootball.com/en/home) - This website is what I use to get my news from, as they are fast and accurate with their information.

- [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/soccer/) - I don't only use ESPN to read the news, as I also like to watch games from this website as they stream my favorite second division team.
